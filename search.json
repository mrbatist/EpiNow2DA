Reported cases returned separate data frame order streamline reporting forecasts model evaluation. range plots returned (single summary plot shown ). plots can also generated using following plot method.","code":"reported_cases <- example_confirmed[1:60] head(reported_cases) #>          date confirm #>        <Date>   <num> #> 1: 2020-02-22      14 #> 2: 2020-02-23      62 #> 3: 2020-02-24      53 #> 4: 2020-02-25      97 #> 5: 2020-02-26      93 #> 6: 2020-02-27      78 estimates <- epinow(   reported_cases = reported_cases,   generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),   delays = delay_opts(incubation_period, reporting_delay),   rt = rt_opts(prior = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.2)),   stan = stan_opts(cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)),   verbose = interactive() ) #> DEBUG [2023-01-24 20:19:35] epinow: Running in exact mode for 2000 samples (across 4 chains each with a warm up of 250 iterations each) and 74 time steps of which 7 are a forecast names(estimates) #> [1] \"estimates\"                \"estimated_reported_cases\" \"summary\"                  #> [4] \"plots\"                    \"timing\" knitr::kable(summary(estimates)) head(summary(estimates, type = \"parameters\", params = \"R\")) #>          date variable strat     type   median     mean         sd lower_90 lower_50 #>        <Date>   <char> <int>   <char>    <num>    <num>      <num>    <num>    <num> #> 1: 2020-02-22        R    NA estimate 2.148647 2.154214 0.14450153 1.929487 2.051622 #> 2: 2020-02-23        R    NA estimate 2.121512 2.125653 0.12003979 1.931839 2.042736 #> 3: 2020-02-24        R    NA estimate 2.093420 2.095419 0.09974015 1.936182 2.027337 #> 4: 2020-02-25        R    NA estimate 2.061786 2.063610 0.08349157 1.930889 2.007475 #> 5: 2020-02-26        R    NA estimate 2.030095 2.030369 0.07109622 1.915872 1.983404 #> 6: 2020-02-27        R    NA estimate 1.996345 1.995861 0.06219250 1.893969 1.956212 #>    lower_20 upper_20 upper_50 upper_90 #>       <num>    <num>    <num>    <num> #> 1: 2.111131 2.185022 2.253146 2.398995 #> 2: 2.091795 2.154419 2.208429 2.328889 #> 3: 2.067632 2.120660 2.161471 2.260970 #> 4: 2.041539 2.084712 2.119120 2.199715 #> 5: 2.011280 2.048115 2.077987 2.146658 #> 6: 1.980218 2.012074 2.036623 2.097979 head(summary(estimates, output = \"estimated_reported_cases\")) #>          date   type median     mean       sd lower_90 lower_50 lower_20 upper_20 #>        <Date> <char>  <num>    <num>    <num>    <num>    <num>    <num>    <num> #> 1: 2020-02-22  gp_rt     50  51.6335 14.08188       32       41     47.0       54 #> 2: 2020-02-23  gp_rt     69  70.4195 18.02745       44       58     64.0       73 #> 3: 2020-02-24  gp_rt     76  78.0840 19.29451       49       64     72.0       81 #> 4: 2020-02-25  gp_rt     79  79.7110 19.49842       51       66     73.0       83 #> 5: 2020-02-26  gp_rt     84  85.7190 21.08341       54       71     79.0       90 #> 6: 2020-02-27  gp_rt    119 121.6290 29.19472       77      101    112.6      127 #>    upper_50 upper_90 #>       <num>    <num> #> 1:       60    77.00 #> 2:       81   103.00 #> 3:       89   112.00 #> 4:       92   114.00 #> 5:       98   123.05 #> 6:      140   173.00 plot(estimates)"},{"path":"epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/index.html","id":"regional_epinow","dir":"","previous_headings":"Quick start","what":"regional_epinow()","title":"Estimate Real-Time Case Counts and Time-Varying\n    Epidemiological Parameters","text":"regional_epinow() function runs epinow() function across multiple regions efficient manner.
